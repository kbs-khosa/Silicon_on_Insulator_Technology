# Silicon_on_Insulator_Technology
# Silicon on Insulator (SOI) is an important wafer manufacturing technique. It haas been able to carry Moore's Law upto some extent but it still faces with some of the challenges which are discussed here along with the advantages.
# The report here also covers 20nm technology node in this technique and the problems that occur while manufacturing the devices in this range.
